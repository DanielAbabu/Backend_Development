# Library Management System Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the Library Management System implemented in Go. The system allows users to manage a library's collection of books and member activities such as borrowing and returning books.

## Folder Structure

```
library_management/
├── main.go
├── controllers/
│   └── library_controller.go
├── models/
│   └── book.go
│   └── member.go
├── services/
│   └── library_service.go
├── docs/

└── go.mod
```

- **main.go**: Entry point of the application.
- **controllers/library_controller.go**: Handles console input and invokes the appropriate service methods.
- **models/book.go**: Defines the Book struct.
- **models/member.go**: Defines the Member struct.
- **services/library_service.go**: Contains business logic and data manipulation functions.
- **docs/documentation.md**: Contains system documentation and other related information.
- **go.mod**: Defines the module and its dependencies.

## Structs

### Book

```go
type Book struct {
    ID     int
    Title  string
    Author string
    Status string // can be "Available" or "Borrowed"
}
```

### Member

```go
type Member struct {
    ID            int
    Name          string
    BorrowedBooks []Book // a slice to hold borrowed books
}
```

## Interfaces

### LibraryManager

```go
type LibraryManager interface {
    AddBook(book Book)
    RemoveBook(bookID int)
    BorrowBook(bookID int, memberID int) error
    ReturnBook(bookID int, memberID int) error
    ListAvailableBooks() []Book
    ListBorrowedBooks(memberID int) []Book
}
```

## Implementation

### Library

The `Library` struct implements the `LibraryManager` interface.

```go
type Library struct {
    Books   map[int]Book
    Members map[int]Member
}
```

### Methods

- **AddBook(book Book)**
  Adds a new book to the library.

- **RemoveBook(bookID int)**
  Removes a book from the library by its ID.

- **BorrowBook(bookID int, memberID int) error**
  Allows a member to borrow a book if it is available.

- **ReturnBook(bookID int, memberID int) error**
  Allows a member to return a borrowed book.

- **ListAvailableBooks() []Book**
  Lists all available books in the library.

- **ListBorrowedBooks(memberID int) []Book**
  Lists all books borrowed by a specific member.

## Console Interaction

### Add a New Book

Prompts the user to enter book details and adds the book to the library.

### Remove an Existing Book

Prompts the user to enter the book ID and removes the book from the library.

### Borrow a Book

Prompts the user to enter the book ID and member ID, and allows the member to borrow the book if it is available.

### Return a Book

Prompts the user to enter the book ID and member ID, and allows the member to return the borrowed book.

### List All Available Books

Displays all available books in the library.

### List All Borrowed Books by a Member

Prompts the user to enter the member ID and displays all books borrowed by the member.

## Error Handling

The system includes error handling for scenarios where books or members are not found, or books are already borrowed. Appropriate error messages are displayed to the user.

## Usage

1. **Start the Application**: Run the `main.go` file to start the console application.
2. **Follow Prompts**: Use the console prompts to add, remove, borrow, and return books, or to list available and borrowed books.

## Dependencies

The `go.mod` file defines the module and its dependencies. Ensure that Go is installed and properly set up on your machine.

## Conclusion

This Library Management System demonstrates the use of structs, interfaces, methods, slices, and maps in Go. The system is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a focus on showcasing key Go functionalities.
